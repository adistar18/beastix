This is an attempt at a BSD-style base system for linux.

The root makefile contains 2 targets:
    make buildworld
    make buildkernel
    make release

Project is structured as follows:

bin/busybox/
   A local copy of the busybox source tree
kernel/
   The linux kernel
obj/
   A build directory, everything builds into here by default
   To clean the tree, just wipe obj/ and then update
rootfs/
   The basic root directory
sbin/
   Root-user only tools (currently empty)
