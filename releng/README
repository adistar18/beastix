This directory contains scripts used for building a release

After doing a "make buildkernel" and "make buildworld" to populate obj/ please perform the following steps in this directory.

 $ vi release_config.mk   # edit release configuration settings (optional)
 $ make release           # build release

The result will be the following files in release/, suitable for distribution on a public FTP server:

	base.tgz
		The base system ready to extract to a root directory
	bzImage
		The compressed linux kernel image
	initrd_live.img
		The base system in initrd form, suitable for use in rescue operations
	initrd_installer.img
		The base system in initrd form, modified with installer script
	src.tar.gz
		A copy of the clean source tree this release was built from
	beastix.iso
		A bootable CD containing the entire release with support for booting the base system in rescue or installer mode (by selecting a different initrd image)
	MD5SUMS
		MD5 hashes of all the other files in the release

Release branches will eventually follow this pattern:

	Beastix-Maj.Min-CURRENT
		Latest version of the code from git, default branch
	Beastix-Maj.Min-RELENG
		Release cut from -CURRENT before cleaning up and preparing for proper release
	Beastix-Maj.Min-RELEASE
		Tagged from Beastix-Maj.Min-RELENG after cleaning up
	Beastix-Maj.Min-UPDATES
		Branched from Beastix-Maj.Min-RELEASE
		Security and bugfixes only, no new features

Development proceeds in -CURRENT (default branch in git) until release time.
At release time, the version number is bumped in the following locations:
	releng/release_config.mk
	releng/mksnapshot.sh
	releng/cd_templ/boot.txt
	rootfs/etc/beastix_version
	rootfs/etc/announce
	README

The following files are also updated in the ports tree:
	VERSION

The ports tree is branched in the same manner as the base system.

A -RELENG branch is then created and feature freezed, no new features are allowed into -RELENG, only bugfixes and security patches

Once -RELENG is considered ready, it is tagged as a -RELEASE, at the same time -UPDATES is branched to allow further bugfixes and security patches


End users should be able to update by replacing the contents of /usr/src with a new git checkout or the contents of src.tar.gz and do the following to update:
 $ make buildkernel
 $ make buildworld
 $ su
 # make installworld
 # make installkernel
