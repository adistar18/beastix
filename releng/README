How a release is built:

1 - Create a temporary root directory
2 - Export the contents of rootfs/ into this directory
3 - Copy the contents of obj/bin/busybox/_install into the directory and make appropriate cleanup changes
4 - Compress the directory
5 - Build a live ISO using the compressed tarball as an initrd
