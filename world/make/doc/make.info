makeinfo version 4.13 from

This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

   This is Edition 0.73, last updated 26 May 2015, of `The GNU Make
Manual', for GNU `make' version 4.1.
